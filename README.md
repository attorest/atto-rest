# atto-rest
_Clean and simple modern WEB services_

### WHAT?
üöÄ Clean (minimal dependencies), strongly typed, asyncronous, robust framework for NodeJS backend development written with TypeScript, designed to solve web problems with cutting-edge technologies, patterns and architecture

### WHY?
##### So, why we create "yet another one" framework in 2019?
Our background motivation is simple: 
- **We creating** it for **ourselves** üòä
- **We want** to run a _clean_ and _simple_ code, 
- **We want** run apps without **libshitting** and app's obesity from scratch because of modules we dependent on
- **We hate** empty repositories with simple logic, that grows your `node_modules` from `0 bytes` to `1 GB` after you run `npm install`
- **We want** to speed-up services and microservices development with modern toolkit and **don't** enlarge complexity
- ***Our target** is lightweight and simple way to solve modern typic task patterns as cute as possible
- **We love** typed node applications and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript)

> Deeply inspired with [zeit/micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro) and desined go by [DRY Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
